# Group-E_Climate-Real-Estate

As climate change and ongoing human events intensify both the scale and frequency of severe environmental events, these consequences also have immediate impacts on real estate, be that housing sale price or home price indices. In profiling four notable natural and manmade disasters in the United States, we aim to understand the immediate and short-term impact that natural destruction and catastrophe induces on the housing market.

This Shiny app explores monthly real estate metrics for five cities before and after a major disaster.  Users can customize visualizations by time period as well as the metric type using interactive maps and charts.
